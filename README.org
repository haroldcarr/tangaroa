* overview

These build and run instructions are for a [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][stack]]-based build.

The [[./README-ORIGINAL.md][original README]] contains [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][cabal]]-based instructions (note that the scripts for cabal-based live in =scripts/cabal= and have not been tested).

* build (stack)

#+begin_example
stack build
#+end_example

* generate keys

#+begin_example
stack exec genkeys -- 9 keys/client_public_keys.txt keys/private_keys
#+end_example

Then link:

#+begin_example
pushd keys
ln -s client_public_keys.txt public_keys.txt
popd
#+end_example

* run

** non BFT Raft

In a terminal:

#+begin_example
./scripts/stack/servers.sh
#+end_example

In a different terminal:

#+begin_example
./scripts/stack/client.sh
#+end_example

In the client terminal, interact as shown (=`# =>`= added to indicate what client returns):

#+begin_example
get foo
# => Failure

insert foo bar
# => Success

get foo
# => bar

set foo baz
# => Success

get foo
# => baz

delete foo
# => Success

get foo
# => Failure
#+end_example

*** termination

Do =^C= in both terminals.

** BFT Raft

Same as above, but use scripts:

#+begin_example
./scripts/stack/bftservers.sh

./scripts/stack/bftclient.sh
#+end_example
